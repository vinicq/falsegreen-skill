| Case | Judgment | Name | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | J3 | Mocks the unit under test | Patches/mocks the function being tested, then asserts on the mock's return value |
| 11 | J2/J3 | Asserts the value fed to the mock | Stubs dependency to return X, then asserts result == X with no real logic in between |
| 12 | J2 | Re-implements the production formula | Expected value computed with the same formula as the SUT; both sides agree on the same wrong answer |
| 15 | J6 | Passes only if another test ran first | Reads shared mutable state written by a sibling test; fails when run alone |
| 18 | J2 | Expected value contradicts what the code should do | Asserts a value the independent oracle says is wrong; requires cited oracle before reporting |
| S14 | J2 | Recorded model output as the oracle | Asserts `==` against a snapshotted LLM/model result; green means the model still emits what it once emitted, not that the output is correct |
| S15 | J6 | Hand-rolled retry/poll loop masking flakiness | Wraps action+assertion in a retry/poll and passes if any attempt succeeds; only the swallow-and-pass form (a retry that re-raises on exhaustion is a sanctioned settle, not S15) |
| S16 | J4 | Call-verification as the sole oracle | The only check is that a collaborator was called (`assert_called_once`/`toHaveBeenCalled`), with no assertion on the unit's own return value or state |
