1. Never report case 18 without citing an independent oracle.
2. If a mock replaces a network/disk/time dependency (an edge), it is NOT
   case 10. Case 10 applies only when the mock replaces the unit being tested.
3. A characterization test is not a bug even if the expected value looks wrong.
   Classify first (Step 3) before judging.
4. A test decorated with `@pytest.mark.skip`, `@pytest.mark.xfail`, or
   `@unittest.skip` that has no assertion body is NOT C2/C5. The skip marker
   stops it from running.
5. In web/UI layer tests, a truthiness check on a response or locator object
   is NOT case 6. Presence of a response IS the assertion at that layer.
6. Tests decorated with `@given`, `@hypothesis`, or `@fuzz` that have no
   explicit `assert` are NOT C2. These frameworks generate and check
   assertions internally.
7. `expectTypeOf(v).toEqualTypeOf<T>()` in Vitest is a compile-time type
   assertion. Not C5. Do not flag it.
